# News App

This app originated as a project for the Udemy course [Next JS with React Hooks - Building SSR React Applications](https://www.udemy.com/course/next-js-react-hooks/) by Ryan Dhungel and it was refactored and added to by Jacqui Koroll for the purpose of learning Next.js.

The app was built using Next.js, React, and TypeScript and uses the [Hacker News API](https://hn.algolia.com/api) to fetch news articles. The CSS was done with  [Material Design for Bootstrap](https://mdbootstrap.com/), Google Fonts, and custom CSS via inline styling. The newspaper icon comes from [IconScout](https://iconscout.com/)
